# üöÄ Deploying a Simple HTML Application to Firebase Hosting with GitHub Actions

This guide will walk you through deploying a simple HTML application to Firebase Hosting using GitHub Actions. Firebase Hosting is a fast, secure, and reliable hosting service for web apps, and GitHub Actions allows for automated deployment whenever changes are pushed to your repository.

## üìù Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- üìß A Google account
- üñ•Ô∏è Node.js and npm installed on your computer
- üîß Firebase CLI installed (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)
- üî• A Firebase project (you can create one at the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/))
- üñ•Ô∏è A GitHub account and repository for your project

## üìÇ Step 1: Set Up Your Project Directory

Create a directory for your project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir simple-html-app
cd simple-html-app
```

Create your HTML file (e.g., `index.html`):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Repl Auth Demo</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Repl Auth Demo</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
      <h2>Welcome to our Demo App!</h2>
      <p>
        This is a simple demo app to show you how you can use Repl Auth to
        authenticate users. You'll see a "Login with Replit" button below. Click
        it to log in and see your user information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <button id="login-button">Login with Replit</button>
      </p>
      <div id="user-info">
        <!-- User information will be displayed here after login -->
      </div>
      <script>
        // This function will be executed when the user logs in
        window.addEventListener("replit-auth-complete", function () {
          // Get the user's information from the Replit Auth headers
          let userId = document.querySelector(
            'meta[name="replit-user-id"]'
          ).content;
          let userName = document.querySelector(
            'meta[name="replit-user-name"]'
          ).content;
          let userRoles = document.querySelector(
            'meta[name="replit-user-roles"]'
          ).content;

          // Display the user's information in the "user-info" div
          document.getElementById("user-info").innerHTML = `
          <p>Welcome, ${userName}!</p>
          <p>Your user ID is: ${userId}</p>
          <p>Your roles are: ${userRoles}</p>
        `;
        });
      </script>
      <div>
        <script
          authed="location.reload()"
          src="https://auth.util.repl.co/script.js"
        ></script>
      </div>
    </main>

    <footer>
      <p>&copy; 2023 Replit Demo App</p>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

## üî• Step 2: Initialize Firebase in Your Project

Run the following command to initialize Firebase in your project directory:

```bash
firebase init
```

Follow the prompts:

- **Hosting:** Select "Hosting: Configure files for Firebase Hosting and set up GitHub Action deploys".
- **Use an existing project:** Select the Firebase project you created earlier.
- **What do you want to use as your public directory?:** Enter `public`.
- **Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all URLs to /index.html)?:** Enter `No`.
- **Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub?:** Enter `Yes`.
- **GitHub repository:** Select your repository or follow the prompts to set up a new repository.

This will create a `firebase.json` configuration file, a `public` directory, and a GitHub Actions workflow file.

## üìÅ Step 3: Move Your HTML File to the Public Directory

Move your `index.html` file to the `public` directory:

```bash
mv index.html public/
```

## üîë Step 4: Add Firebase Token to GitHub Secrets

Obtain a Firebase CI token by running:

```bash
firebase login:ci
```

Copy the token, then go to your GitHub repository's settings, navigate to "Secrets and variables" > "Actions", and add a new secret named `FIREBASE_TOKEN` with the copied token as its value.

## üåê Step 5: Deploy to Firebase

Deploy your application to Firebase Hosting by running:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

Once the deployment is complete, you will see a URL where your app is hosted.

## üîÑ Step 6: Verify GitHub Actions Workflow

When you initialized Firebase with GitHub Actions, a workflow file was created automatically. Verify that the workflow file exists and is configured correctly.

The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-pull-request.yml`. It should look like this:

### Auto deploy when Merge with GitHub Code

```yaml
name: Deploy to Firebase Hosting on merge
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build_and_deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "No build needed"
      - uses: FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy@v0
        with:
          repoToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          firebaseServiceAccount: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SIMPLE_WEBAPP_C49B5 }}
          channelId: live
          projectId: simple-webapp-c49b5
```

### Auto Deploy when raised with PR

```yaml
name: Deploy to Firebase Hosting on PR
on: pull_request
permissions:
  checks: write
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
jobs:
  build_and_preview:
    if: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "No build needed"
      - uses: FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy@v0
        with:
          repoToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          firebaseServiceAccount: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SIMPLE_WEBAPP_C49B5 }}
          projectId: simple-webapp-c49b5
```

## üåê Step 7: View Your Deployed App

Open the URL provided by Firebase in your web browser to see your deployed HTML application.

## üìö Additional Information

### üîÑ Updating Your Application

To update your application, make changes to your files in the `public` directory, and then push the changes to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository. GitHub Actions will automatically deploy the updates to Firebase.

### üîß Useful Firebase CLI Commands

- **Login to Firebase:** `firebase login`
- **Initialize a Firebase project:** `firebase init`
- **Deploy to Firebase Hosting:** `firebase deploy`
